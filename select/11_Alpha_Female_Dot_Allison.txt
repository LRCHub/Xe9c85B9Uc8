She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She didn't want to conquer you
Another misconception
It tasted strange
She can't explain
But it's all forgotten now
Her fingerprints
Are on your hands
That's all she's left for you
You just untangled all her words
They're inexpensive now
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
You walked the world
It's almost over now
Your satellite escape each day
You've got an alpha female muse
A little introspection
She isn't there to be misused
The shallowest reflection
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
